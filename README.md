I wanted to track some of the ttps/methods I was learning while in CRTO2. This isnt perfect, and will be refined over time. Some of the API calls are still very vague. Theres some obvious ttps that I left out to reduce noise. These are commented out in the ruleset and can be changed. This is a mix of things ive found from other creators and some ive implemeted myself/tweaked.

Research that helped:
https://github.com/jsecurity101/TelemetrySource jsecurity for rev engineering sysmon and correlating events to win32 API calls.
and as always; thanks to the spectreops bois
